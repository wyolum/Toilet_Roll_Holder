# Toilet_Roll_Holder
Shaun the Sheep Toilet Roll Holder for storing a spare toilet roll

Based on Shaun the Sheep Toilet Paper Roll Holder (Easy to Print) by e_grnsmnn at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6194202

I redesigned the face and tail section from the ground up to allow for roll tube diameter variations. The base and the four legs are the same as in the original.

## How I Designed This

To accommodate different roll tube diameters, I use four pieces of 1.75 mm dia printer filament which act as springs and push against the inner cardboard tube - see the photos. By making the spring pieces longer or shorter, you can adjust how they fit the cardboard tubes. If you find PLA spring pieces too hard, then try more flexible filaments such as TPU.
